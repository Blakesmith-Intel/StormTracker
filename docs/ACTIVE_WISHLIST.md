# V10.2.36 — unified cyclone interface and multiple original track systems

- **[x] Cyclones** under Severe Weather now shows the original live-source checkbox and source verification status directly below a consistent heading, with a compact Details/Hide details control instead of an extra floating/panel workflow.
- **[x] Each source-qualified current cyclone** has its own system card, source name/ID/issue/expiry, independently enabled issued-track map overlay and camera-safe Focus control. Several true BoM forecast tracks can be overlaid at once; disabling one leaves other maps enabled.
- **[x] Each cyclone card includes a clearly qualified separate BoM tropical cyclone warning link** rather than assuming an official warning bulletin is contained in the forecast map feed. The original authenticated feed, expiry rules, five-minute enabled polling, no-current versus unverified safeguards remain unchanged.
- **[x] Strictly UI-only** relative to radar, floods, rainfall/AEP, outage, road closure and the approved V10.2.35 four-section menu. Operator guide and one-page quick reference updated. See [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V10.2.36.md).
- **[ ] Public release acceptance** requires full build, live mobile/desktop interactions and independent multi-system UI simulation before annotated tag `v10.2.36` and recovery branch creation.

# V10.2.35 four-section operator menu — approved UI-only redesign

- **[x] Four independent, default-collapsed top-level sections:** Radar & Storm Analysis, Severe Weather, Rainfall Observations and Community Impacts. All original controls remain bound; collapsing never switches off an active map layer.
- **[x] Essential actions immediately visible:** original radar playback/status and storm tracking, four-product BoM warnings with source-confirmed No current warnings, Flood Gauges and inline genuine-source Cyclones, significant rainfall reporting and AEP, and road/outage/QFD toggles.
- **[x] Secondary legends collapsible:** radar/3-D display opacity, flood severity and rapid-rise/crossing symbols, original rainfall/AEP rarity legend, track-scope information and existing QFD incident symbols.
- **[x] Original Street/Satellite basemap selector moved intact** into compact Map style beside map radar tools; primary/supplemental radars, map measurement, compass and reset unchanged. Outages/road closures source count shortcuts remain permanently visible.
- **[x] All existing feed cadences, original geometry, map-science algorithms, layer IDs, warnings source statuses, reports and saved preferences preserved.** Source-preview and live acceptance requirements documented in [V10.2.35 release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V10.2.35.md).
- **[ ] Release acceptance**: exact pinned production build, browser-mobile/desktop interaction and real public deployment, followed by NEW immutable v10.2.35 recovery references; earlier tags unaffected.

# V10.2.34 — collapsible Situational Awareness Data (30 October 2026)

The approved top-level **Situational Awareness Data** card now uses a native HTML `details` disclosure, matching the Show/Hide interaction of **Severe Weather**. It is collapsed by default and independently expandable. All existing basemap, significant rainfall/AEP, unplanned road closures, power outages and QFD rescue/assistance controls are kept as direct children with identical IDs, ordering, checked states, reports, event handlers and refresh intervals. Closing this menu does **not** disable active map layers. Change is limited to the fail-closed production HTML transform, scoped CSS, browser cache version, tests and operator documentation. V10.2.33 and earlier frozen versions remain untouched.

# V10.2.32 additional BoM warning product selections — complete when deployed

- **[x] Individual IDQ product dropdown:** All warnings, IDQ21035 detailed SEQ thunderstorms, IDQ21033 regional Queensland thunderstorms, IDQ21037 Severe Weather 1 and IDQ21038 Severe Weather 2. All four have independently verified **No current warnings** states in the shared 15-minute warning refresh, manual ↻ override, correct original polygon filter and an independent LDMG/DDMG report section even with no active warning. No extra request per option or speculative warning polygon. See [V10.2.32 release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V10.2.32.md).

---
# V10.2.33 operator sidebar reorganisation — approved / implemented

- **[x] New top-level expandable Severe Weather group**: contains the original flood signals/gauges, four-product BoM Severe Weather and Thunderstorm Warnings, and a real current-source cyclone panel opening inline within the sidebar. The option to hide/expand this group does not independently toggle or refresh the weather feeds.
- **[x] Rename Layers → Situational Awareness Data** for unchanged basemap, significant rainfall/AEP, QLDTraffic closures, unplanned outages and QFD incident overlays.
- **[x] Preserve** Flood and BoM warning controls/IDs/defaults, exact warning geometry and LDMG/DDMG reports, the current cyclone feed's source-verification and focus semantics, and all existing refresh intervals. No additional requests, historical cyclone cases, or alternate map UI.
- Acceptance requirement: production Pages publication and real browser interaction must pass before sealing **v10.2.33**, leaving all previously frozen tags untouched. See [V10.2.33 release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V10.2.33.md) and [operator guide](OPERATOR_GUIDE_CURRENT.md).

# StormTracker — active wishlist after V10.2.31 verified BoM current-warning negative reporting

**Status: 30 October 2026.** The original warning-area wishlist item is marked **COMPLETE**, sealed as V10.2.29; the follow-up V10.2.30 terminology and compact cell marker presentation is subject to production verification. The underlying V10.2.0 radar/science baseline and previous frozen references remain unchanged. [Current operator guide](OPERATOR_GUIDE_CURRENT.md) · [V10.2.29 release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V10.2.29.md) · [Development handover](DEVELOPMENT_HANDOVER_CURRENT.md).

## Delivered and frozen — no unrequested tinkering

- **[x] Verified per-product no-current warning reporting (V10.2.31):** Official time-stamped Queensland current-warnings summary independently confirms that a product is not current, including IDQ21035, even when WMO historical CAP samples are truncated. Active warnings remain active while original GIS polygons are publishing; source failures remain unverified rather than an invented all-clear. Observed intense rain cannot escalate a heavy-rainfall warning without an actual forecast/source-coded high-end hazard.

- Authentic native BoM reflectivity/rain radar, multi-radar Doppler, inferred 3-D and operational track/cone workflows remain as accepted.
- QLD flood signals, rapid-rise, crossing levels, rainfall IFD/AEP, agency timestamps, roads, outages and QFD incidents, with their existing reports, are preserved.
- **[x] Official BoM Queensland severe warning polygons — completed:** Source-issued `IDQ21033` regional warning areas (`IDQ65654`) and `IDQ21035` detailed threat areas (`IDQ65650`), without artificial geographic reconstruction; independently valid bulletin and polygon times; proper on-map placement above satellite and below measured radar; consistent source-confirmed negative reporting; product-specific filtering; stable camera-controller **Locate**; tap/click polygon to open the exact same LDMG/DDMG report as the button; every official boundary intersection included, no minimum sliver cutoff; 15-minute and manual refresh; source revision, expiry and cancellation lifecycle.
- **[x] BoM high-end terms separated from individual cells:** IDQ21033 area-wide headline/description/phenomena can name destructive winds, giant hail, intense rainfall or tornadoes; the map/status/report highlights the higher-end **published warning terms**, not non-existent regional tracks. The IDQ21035 **VD** badge belongs only to the particular source-attributed IDQ65652 storm location and is compact enough for the live radar map.
- **[x] Detailed IDQ21035 cell-source integration preconfigured:** The separately specified `IDQ65652` official *storm location* source is queried independently while an actual detailed bulletin is active. Only fresh, source-matched, individual cell geometries can appear. A **VERY DANGEROUS** label requires the cell's own original source record to explicitly assign that designation; blanket bulletin-based labels are prohibited.
- **[ ] Live cell-specific validation remaining:** Government mirror had **zero available `IDQ65652` storm-location records on 30 October 2026**. A future genuine issue is required to validate per-cell identity, location continuity and the Very Dangerous callout on an actual affected cell. This is NOT a currently demonstrated live cell-tracking capability, and the map must not infer storm motion or treat threat polygons as individual cells.

## Deferred by explicit operator direction

**Official tropical cyclone live forecast map:** defer until a live cyclone exists so geometry can be checked against a genuine current BoM warning product. Existing historical and internal QA references remain untouched. Do not restart repetitive cyclone trials in the absence of a live case.

## Remaining scoped investigations — only on operator request

1. **Live individual detailed cell acceptance only:** if BoM publishes `IDQ65652` storm locations in the accessible mirrored GIS layer, verify genuine cell ID continuity, geometry source/refresh and source-attributed **VERY DANGEROUS** callout using an actual current BoM cell. `IDQ65650` threat geometry and `IDQ21033` regional geometry already have independently tested live warning-area display paths. Missing original cell records must not be simulated.
2. **NSW official severe warnings:** still withheld until a verified geographic clip against the real union of installed radar footprints (including Brewarrina, Moree, Grafton and overlapping QLD sites) is available. Never approximate radar extent using a bounding rectangle.
3. **Experimental Doppler severe-wind science:** real BoM AURA sweep decoding, aliasing/georeferencing and historical validation before any straight-line-wind, hook-echo or tornado-candidate indication becomes operational. These are **not official BoM warnings**.
4. **Observed lightning:** not implemented, future consideration only if a reliable no-cost appropriately licensed source is established.

## Permanent non-negotiables

- Never alter the original measured BoM radar resolution, Doppler times, 3-D dBZ thresholds, flood marker styles, IFD/AEP source integration, incident icon sizing or previously accepted operational features without explicit approval.
- Use original geographic source vertices, accurate positions and full original boundaries; the tiny-overlap **“bee's dick principle”** applies to official warning/LGA/DDMG intersections without a minimum threshold.
- Missing, late, malformed, incomplete or unverified data is **unavailable**; no-source is not automatically no-hazard. Expired/cancelled warnings must not remain on the map as active.
- Keep the browser-only design, static GitHub Pages plus the **single existing** Cloudflare relay; no new paid service, unnecessary background tasks or news-media source lookups.
- Existing annotated tags and `restore/*` branches are immutable. Promote only after tests and live website verification, seal a NEW tag/restore pair and document rollback.

Historical original priorities (as at 16 October 2026) are retained in Git history; the above is the current authoritative wishlist.
